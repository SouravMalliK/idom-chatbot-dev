But our neighbours were always talking behind our back.","para_4":"They said, my mother had only crocodile tears for Bilu and her real intent was to get the household chores done by him. The neighbours were all smiles before us, however. But I knew for sure, my mother’s affection for Bilu was more than genuine.","para_1":"Bilu and I were friends, in fact very close friends. Bilu was small and shy, while I was big and talkative. He lived nearby and we used to study in the same class. Well, Bilu was very good at literature and History, but I insisted that these subjects were of absolutely no use. I was fond and a proponent of science, so I maintained that after all, the world is run by physical laws, which are of real importance, and what better explains these laws – science of course! ","para_2":"His family was poor as his father was a daily labourer. This is why my mother had a special soft corner for Bilu – a sympathy. She loved us equally. However, I was always complaining that she had more love for my friend than me. Mother did not pay any attention to my complaints, Bilu being so much a part and parcel of our family.

For example,   You need not call him. He never calls you, after all.  or You should visit your mother more often—after all, she won't live forever. or Don’t punish Uday for his mischiefs. He is only 3 years old after all. or I thought, you would know a few businessmen. You are a man of connections after all.  Also try this idiom to mean ‘finally’ or ‘ultimately’ or ‘everything said and done’ or ‘whatever you say’. For example,   It looks like Siddhartha will go to school, after all.   Or I think I shall have something to eat after all.  In the above story, ‘after all’ is used this way as ‘I’ was trying to convince Bilu that whatever Bilu said, the world is run by physical laws.","origin":"","meaning":"Considering the circumstances. “After all” is used as considerations; or in view of the facts, this is the consideration; or ultimately; "},"__collections__":{}},"tr69XKg4Ohd099KHhjPz":{"title":"Crocodile tears","sub_title":"Chapter 2","image_url":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/idiom-chatbot-dev-ckfyuh.appspot.com/o/idioms-gif-animations%2Fcrocodile-tears-image.png?alt=media&token=d139662c-f96e-4159-8dd4-d939e3d0a768","explanation":{"examples":"","origin":"It is an ancient idea that crocodiles weep/cry while eating their prey.
